# friendfinder
## What the project does
This project allows the user to take a survey and will match them to a compatible friend in the database.
## Why the project is useful
The matching process is based on similar preferences/personality traits.  A compatible friend should have the closest answers to the user.
## How users can get started with the project
Click the "Begin!" button on the home page to visit the survey page.  Fill in your name and a link to your photo at the top of the page.  Then, complete the 10 questions by choosing a number from the dropdown boxes that most closely matches how much you agree or disagree.  After clicking "Submit," the most compatible profile to yours will be displayed.
